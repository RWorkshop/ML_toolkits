The Sonar Data Set

===================================================
The Sonar data consist of 208 data points collected on 60 predictors. The goal is to predict the two
classes (M for metal cylinder or R for rock).

First, we split the data into two groups: a training set and a test set. 
To do this, the **createDataPartition** function is used

```{r}

library(caret)
library(mlbench)
data(Sonar)
set.seed(107)
